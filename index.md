## Who I am as a Programmer
I came into UCSD having no experience in coding or much of any Computer Science fundamentals, thus it was 
difficult for me to understand how to code and grasp the information quickly. 

My first ever project was creating an [informational website](http://spis-eclipse-timer.herokuapp.com/) that displayed a countdown timer for the next solar eclipse in North America, and included various places throughout the continent that is the best to view it from. Completing this project
has piqued my interest for software engineering, especially for front-end development, and I knew I wanted to do something like that in the future. 

### My career goals
- [] Graduate and get a SWE role, preferably as a full-stack developer.  
- [] Work for my dream company, Riot Games, and have exposure to game development. 
- [] Become a senior software engineer.
